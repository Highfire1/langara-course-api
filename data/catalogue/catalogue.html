This course will explore the history and complex issues surrounding one of the most controversial forms of art in our culture - art in public places.  Beginning with an overview of the historical significance of public art, we will focus primarily on the diversity of movements as they emerge within the context of dramatic social change in the 20th century up to the present.  Tradition, corporate agendas and politics clash with the avant-garde, vandalism and activism on the streets of our cities.  Public art acts as a barometer of and catalyst to shifts in society.  We will examine art in the urban landscape that is at the centre of many debates, including the ownership and function of public space, censorship, homelessness, environmental crisis, and public health and safety.

<h2>AHIS 1218 (3 credits) (3:0:0)</h2>
<b>Intoxicating Encounters: Images of Global Exchange, 1492–1900</b>
<br />
<br />
The final years of the 15th century heralded a new imagining of the world.  Direct contact between Europe, Asia and the Americas ushered in a period of commercial, cultural, and technological exchange.  But its result was far greater than the mere exchange of commodities and currencies.  The encounters between Asia, America and Europe signaled not only the beginnings of a global market but also a global consciousness that transformed the everyday experiences of millions of people.  This course will focus on images that represent the conflict and convergence of cultures in the fervor for scientific and geographical knowledge that coexisted with the expansion of eastern and western empires from 1492 into the early 19th century.

While the course will generally follow a historic chronology, the material content will be thematic including such topics as the impact of intoxicants and stimulants such as opium, tobacco, tea, coffee and cacao on local economies and foreign sociability; the devastation of populations in Europe and the Americas as a result of the transfer of disease; European bourgeois clothing and its tie to the fur trade in Canada; origin myths; and maps as evidence of claim to contested territories, to name but a few.

<b>South Asian Art</b>
<br />
<br />
From its pre-modern roots in the Indus Valley Civilization to the contemporary works of Subodh Gupta, students in this course survey the development of South Asian visual and material culture. The remarkable artistic creations that emerge from the present-day nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka attest to the connections and continuities between these distinct modern states. By making connections, students learn of the importance of exchange and interaction between religions, cultures, and various groups, such as Buddhists, Hindus, Jains, Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians, on the one hand, and Indians, Persians, Europeans, Central Asians, and Southeast Asians, on the other. Students further connect South Asian art and material culture to the broader history of the subcontinent. In this class, learners tackle traditional art-historical concerns, such as visual/iconographic analysis, explore the role of the artist and systems of patronage, as well as stylistic development, significance of materials, and theories of aesthetics. Students also relate South Asian art to its broader social, political, economic, and other dynamic contexts.

<b>Art and Intersectionality</b>

<br />
Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how aspects of a person's identity intertwine in relation to structures of power and privilege. These include aspects of intersectionality such as gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, physical and cognitive ability and appearance, etc. In this course students study art and visual culture from the perspective of intersectionality, where images and objects become contested sites of power, privilege and oppression. Through case studies, students explore how representations of various intersectionalities in art have traditionally expressed and reinforced cultural stereotypes in particular historical moments. Students also look at ways in which art has functioned to critique these stereotypes and challenge the status quo.

<h2>AHIS 1317 (3 credits) (3:0:1)</h2>
<b>Cultural Heritage in Crisis</b>
<br />
<br />
In recent times, objects of cultural heritage have become contested sites where power struggles play out around political, racial, religious, class, sexual, and gender issues etc. The destruction of cultural heritage has become a tool of war and cultural cleansing. It features in protests calling for social justice. It has also resulted from natural disasters and climate change. Theft of culturally significant objects has been used to profit from the oppressed, control marginalized peoples, and in some cases conduct genocide. This course makes explicit the ways in which cultural heritage can be a symbol and visual reinforcement of oppressive power and a tool of propaganda denouncing certain groups. Students explore how vandalism and destruction of objects or sites can contribute to cultural genocide. In this course, students look at cultural heritage in the context of how these power struggles operate by examining aspects of conflict, commemoration, social justice movements, cultural appropriation, vandalism, destruction, theft, and repatriation.

<h2>ANTH 2234 (3 credits) (3:1:0)</h2>
<b>Ancient Civilization: Origins, Development and Collapse</b>
<br />
<br />
The origins and development of urban cultures and attendant states and empires represents one of the most important institutions of the modern global community. Between 10-15,000 years ago some populations began to aggregate in year-round villages based upon horticulture and/or agriculture. This led to the development of the earliest urban centres. Today, the majority of the global population lives in cities thanks to agricultural-industrial economies. This course investigates the process of cultural developments arising from settled lifestyles, food production systems, and the development of complex socio-political institutions, including models of cultural collapse. A regional focus is followed using examples from the Near East, Easter Island and the Andean region of South America.

<h2>APPL 5140 (3 credits) (3:1:0)</h2>
<b>Planning Process & Law</b>
<br />
<br />
While persuasion can achieve significant results, community planning requires regulatory powers to be effective. Communities receive their authority to regulate planning through Provincial legislation, and in some cases planning decisions are also guided by applicable Federal laws. That authority is both limited and prescriptive.  This course introduces students to the enabling legislation that both authorizes and limits planning practice in BC. This includes the legal requirements for plan adoption and the development approval process. The course will focus on those aspects of the planning process and law considered most relevant to planners and planning technicians practicing in BC.

<h2>CNST 4850 (3 credits) (3:1:0)</h2>
<b>Work in Canadian Society</b>
<br />
<br />
Work dominates a significant part of our lives and determines not only what we do many hours a day, but also who we meet, how we see and define ourselves, and at what standard we live. In this course, we will examine the larger forces that have an impact on our decisions about work and its conditions, some history about how work has been shaped and how groups of workers have organized to improve their working lives, and the effects of gender, race, and class on paid and unpaid work. 

Students will receive credit for only one of CNST 1130 or 4850. CNST 1130 may not be used to satisfy the CNST 4850 requirement.

Registration in this course is restricted to students admitted to the Post-Degree Certificate in Diversity and Inclusion Leadership.

<h2>FINA 2261 (3 credits) (1:2:1)</h2>
<b>Public Art Studio Practice II</b>
<br />
<br />
Students continue the investigation into the issues surrounding the creation of public art. Students work in groups to execute and complete two essential phases for a singular, large-scale, materially based project to be installed on the Langara College campus and at various public venues such as the Canada Line SkyTrain Langara-49th Station facade. While the emphasis is on group work, independent projects are also assigned. Project dependent technical demonstrations, lectures, weekly discussions, site visits, and critiques help the students develop the language surrounding public art in contemporary and historical contexts while encouraging students to articulate their ideas for the built environment. The skills and portfolio developed during this course can be used when applying to public art calls outside of the institution.

<h2>HIST 2234 (3 credits) (3:1:0)</h2>
<b>Socialism in one Country: A History of the Soviet Union, 1917–1991</b>
<br />
<br />
This course offers a comprehensive interpretation of the Russian historical experience from 1917 to 1991. It attempts to strike a reasonable balance between the Stalin years, which have been the focus of much attention, and the post-Stalinist period. While recognizing the profound influence Stalin exerted on Soviet history, the course also explores the various efforts at de-Stalinization, which occurred after his death, through the Gorbachev era.  Moving beyond the standard emphasis on ideological matters, the course seeks to explore the social issues and decision-making processes during the Soviet period.

Prerequisite(s): A minimum "C-" grade in HIST 1115; or permission of the instructor. HIST 1115 and 2234 may be taken concurrently.

<h2>HIST 2236 (3 credits) (4:0:0)</h2>
<b>The Franks: From Barbarian Trb to Imprl Mission-the Destiny of the Merovingians and the Carolingians</b>
<br />
<br />
The Franks first appear in historical sources during the third century A.D. as a group of undistinguished barbarians living in the lowlands north and east of the Rhine frontier of the Roman Empire.  From this undistinguished beginning, they created the most powerful of all the barbarian kingdoms and became the effective heirs of the Roman Empire. In 800, a Frank was crowned in Rome as the first emperor of Germanic origins.  Utilizing contemporary documents and archaeological evidence, this course traces the history of the Franks from barbarism to their military and civil dominance of western Europe.

<h2>HIST 2237 (3 credits) (4:0:0)</h2>
<b>Popes, Emperors and Kings: Aspects of the History of Medieval Political Theory</b>
<br />
<br />
The concept of the separation of church and state - indeed, the idea of the modern state itself - grew out of a struggle between the kings, emperors and popes of medieval Europe. The polemics and the developments in law derived from the crucial medieval debate have left their imprint on the course of Western history. This course will discuss such vital issues as the nature of authority, justice, and property; the problem of legitimacy, allegiance, the right of resistance to the powers that be; and the character and function of law. These concepts form the very foundation of western societies and the medieval debate is relevant to an understanding of contemporary institution and ideas.

Against the backdrop of World War II, students explore the events and circumstances which led to the division of the world into two mutually hostile camps, the communist and the capitalist, each under the aegis of the USSR and the USA respectively. This polarization of world politics carried with it the danger that any conflict between the two superpowers might ignite a world-wide conflict.

<b>Vietnam: From Colonial War to Cold War, 1945–1975</b>
<br />
<br />
This course looks at the various decisions made by the great powers which turned a deaf ear to the postwar Vietnamese desire for independence and instead ushered in a period of unrelenting turmoil and suffering. France's attempt to re-establish her colonial overlordship in Vietnam ended in failure in 1954, with the United States subsequently stepping in to prevent South Vietnam from falling victim to Communism. As an important "domino", South Vietnam became a recipient of US military and economic aid, to ensure her survival as part of the free world. In the end, however, the costs of such policies became unbearable, at home as well as abroad and like France before her, the United States too had to pull out of Vietnam.

<h2>HIST 2247 (3 credits) (2:2:0)</h2>
<b>Canada and the World Wars</b>
<br />
<br />
Canada's involvement in the two world wars led to dramatic growth and maturation of the nation. It moved away from its colony-nation status as part of the British Empire and by 1945, had moved into the United States' sphere of influence. As a result of World War II, Canada boasted the fifth largest military on Earth and was well on its way to becoming one of the wealthiest nations on the planet. This period also witnessed dramatic social change as women received the vote and the foundations for the social welfare state were laid. Students explore a broad range of topics related to the political, social, economic, and military events that surrounded Canada's participation in the two world wars while identifying the changes wrought upon the Canadian state and Canadian people as a result of the country's involvement.

<h2>HIST 2251 (3 credits) (2:2:0)</h2>
<b>Islam from Mongols to Modernity</b>

This course presents a study of the early modern and modern history of the Muslim world, beginning with the Mongol conquests of the mid 13th century and ending with the modern day. The course will examine the period from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, considering history, theological and judicial developments, philosophy, scientific thought, literature and art. Particular emphasis will be placed on the role that Islam has played in the unfolding of events in the Muslim world and how far the issues that have arisen in the region have been affected by the religiosity of its inhabitants. In adopting this perspective, the course will demonstrate how the Muslim world has developed into the form it has at present, enabling students better to understand the events and issues that they see making headlines today. The readings assigned in this course will include both primary sources and secondary literature.

<h2>HIST 2252 (3 credits) (2:2:0)</h2>
<b>History and Religion in Islam Art</b>

This course involves study of the architecture and artifacts of Islam as a reflection of Islamic beliefs and historical developments. Since its rise in Arabia in the seventh century, Islamic society has produced many beautiful works of architecture and decoration, but how far do these works reflect Islamic beliefs, and how far would it be more accurate to regard them as a reflection of historical realities? What do we actually mean when we describe forms of artistic expression as being distinctively "Islamic?" This course will seek to answer these questions through an examination of various forms of Islamic art, including architecture, paintings, ceramics, calligraphy and sculpture.

<h2>PHIL 1104 (3 credits) (3:1:0)</h2>
<b>Critical Thinking</b>
<br />
<br />
Thinking critically means knowing how to support your beliefs and actions with good reasons and how to evaluate reasons given by others.  In this course, you will learn to distinguish good from bad arguments as they occur in everyday discussions, including in the news media, political campaigns, advertising, and other contexts.  The goal is to help you to cultivate a solid habit of going through life as a critical thinker, which should lead to better reasoned decision-making, rather than decisions based on unexamined opinions, impulse, prejudice, or social pressure.  Students will be taught, through extensive examples, how to understand, criticize, and construct arguments, and how to recognize common errors in reasoning.

ESL students who have difficulty reading or writing English may find this course challenging.  They are encouraged to discuss their participation in this course with the instructor.

<h2>PHIL 2160 (3 credits) (4:0:0)</h2>
<b>Philosophy & Literature</b>
<br />
<br />
Philosophy aims to describe the world and our experience within it as accurately and thoroughly as possible, while literature shows some important aspects of human existence by using literary devices like metaphors which force the reader to make subjective interpretations about the writer's messages and intent. In spite of this fact, literature has proven to be a powerful vehicle for philosophical messages. This course will consider both the philosophy of literature, such as what is literature and can subjective interpretations achieve truth, and philosophy through literature, in which we study philosophical concepts through literary works. Students will learn why we love to be scared, why tragedy is so appealing, what an individual's obligations are to herself and the state, etc.

Early Modern Philosophy responds to tumultuous times in Europe. Medieval scholasticism was in disrepute as the Scientific Revolution took hold. This course focuses on the distinctive character of this period as it wrestled with the metaphysical and epistemological problems raised by scientific developments. Students critically evaluate the views and enduring influence of such thinkers such as Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Hume, and Kant, in regards to questions such as: What is the relationship between reality and our perceptions of reality? What is the nature of the mind and how is it related to the body? What is the nature of physical reality?

How can you create a meaningful life for yourself out of the possibilities of human existence?

<h2>SOCI 2205 (3 credits) (3:1:0)</h2>
<b>Sociology of Deviance</b>

<br />
Most people would not consider themselves as deviants as they would assume it refers to criminal behaviour. However, the fact is that everyone is a deviant in some way because deviance is both relative and socially constructed. Students examine sociological theories of deviance, focusing on their application to contemporary issues such as the relationship between crime and deviance and gender inequality, racism, and class discrimination. In addition, students explore areas such as sexual deviance, sociopathy, and crimes of power with a focus on understanding their role and impact on both the individual and society.

<h2>WMST 2270 (3 credits) (3:1:0)</h2>
<b>Gender Currents: Femininity, Masculinity, and Beyond</b>
<br />
<br />
"Is it a boy or a girl?" This course explores the multiple meanings behind this seemingly simple question. It introduces students to critiques of the gender binary and theoretical perspectives from feminist, masculinity, queer, and transgender studies. Students will gain fluency in themes such as gender performativity; biological essentialism and heteronormativity; the queering of gender identities; transgender insights into embodiment and self-representation; and the intersections between gender, class, race, and sexuality. The course also explores rich traditions of activism in both mainstream and nonconforming communities: the role of political and cultural actors in "stirring the gender pot" at home, work, and play.

Prerequisite(s): A minimum "C-" grade in WMST 1116 or 1216.
