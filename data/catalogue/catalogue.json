Tradition, corporate agendas and politics clash with the avant-garde, vandalism and activism on the streets of our cities.  Public art acts as a barometer of and catalyst to shifts in society.  We will examine art in the urban landscape that is at the centre of many debates, including the ownership and function of public space, censorship, homelessness, environmental crisis, and public health and safety."

Direct contact between Europe, Asia and the Americas ushered in a period of commercial, cultural, and technological exchange.  But its result was far greater than the mere exchange of commodities and currencies.  The encounters between Asia, America and Europe signaled not only the beginnings of a global market but also a global consciousness that transformed the everyday experiences of millions of people.  This course will focus on images that represent the conflict and convergence of cultures in the fervor for scientific and geographical knowledge that coexisted with the expansion of eastern and western empires from 1492 into the early 19th century.\n\nWhile the course will generally follow a historic chronology, the material content will be thematic including such topics as the impact of intoxicants and stimulants such as opium, tobacco, tea, coffee and cacao on local economies and foreign sociability; the devastation of populations in Europe and the Americas as a result of the transfer of disease; European bourgeois clothing and its tie to the fur trade in Canada; origin myths; and maps as evidence of claim to contested territories, to name but a few."

The remarkable artistic creations that emerge from the present-day nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka attest to the connections and continuities between these distinct modern states. By making connections, students learn of the importance of exchange and interaction between religions, cultures, and various groups, such as Buddhists, Hindus, Jains, Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians, on the one hand, and Indians, Persians, Europeans, Central Asians, and Southeast Asians, on the other. Students further connect South Asian art and material culture to the broader history of the subcontinent. In this class, learners tackle traditional art-historical concerns, such as visual/iconographic analysis, explore the role of the artist and systems of patronage, as well as stylistic development, significance of materials, and theories of aesthetics. Students also relate South Asian art to its broader social, political, economic, and other dynamic contexts."

Through case studies, students explore how representations of various intersectionalities in art have traditionally expressed and reinforced cultural stereotypes in particular historical moments. Students also look at ways in which art has functioned to critique these stereotypes and challenge the status quo."

It features in protests calling for social justice. It has also resulted from natural disasters and climate change. Theft of culturally significant objects has been used to profit from the oppressed, control marginalized peoples, and in some cases conduct genocide. This course makes explicit the ways in which cultural heritage can be a symbol and visual reinforcement of oppressive power and a tool of propaganda denouncing certain groups. Students explore how vandalism and destruction of objects or sites can contribute to cultural genocide. In this course, students look at cultural heritage in the context of how these power struggles operate by examining aspects of conflict, commemoration, social justice movements, cultural appropriation, vandalism, destruction, theft, and repatriation."

Between 10-15,000 years ago some populations began to aggregate in year-round villages based upon horticulture and/or agriculture. This led to the development of the earliest urban centres. Today, the majority of the global population lives in cities thanks to agricultural-industrial economies. This course investigates the process of cultural developments arising from settled lifestyles, food production systems, and the development of complex socio-political institutions, including models of cultural collapse. A regional focus is followed using examples from the Near East, Easter Island and the Andean region of South America."

            "title": "Introduction to Classical Chinese II",
            "description": "Chinese 3333 is part two of an introduction to classical Chinese. It is designed for students who are fluent in Mandarin Chinese or one of the Chinese dialects and who can read and write Chinese comfortably at an intermediate level, e.g., completion of elementary school or higher in China or Taiwan.  In this course, students will first study a selection of ancient poetic and prose works from the Han, Tang and Song dynasties (ca. 200 BC - 1200 AD). They will then be introduced to the dramas and novels of later centuries (ca. 1300 - 1800 AD).  More grammatical analysis and comparisons will be done between the ancient and the modern languages. At the end of this course, students will have gained a general idea of the whole development of Chinese history and literature. They will be expected to understand and appreciate a number of ancient works, as well as to be able to use their knowledge to create some simple works of their own in classical style.\n\nPrerequisite(s): Students who have not completed CHIN 3331 should consult an instructor of Chinese before registering in this course. Students should have already completed at least a  second-year college Chinese course or equivalent, e.g., completion of six years of elementary school or more in China or Taiwan,  and know about 2000 Chinese characters."

In 800, a Frank was crowned in Rome as the first emperor of Germanic origins.

As an important \"domino\", South Vietnam became a recipient of US military and economic aid, to ensure her survival as part of the free world. In the end, however, the costs of such policies became unbearable, at home as well as abroad and like France before her, the United States too had to pull out of Vietnam."

How do we fairly distribute the burdens of environmental stewardship between nations and between generations? Do we owe any moral obligations to future generations? Are groups, like species and ecosystems, deserving of moral consideration? Must we promote sustainability? When, if ever, may we engage in acts of violence in order to protect animals and/or the ecosystem?"

In spite of this fact, literature has proven to be a powerful vehicle for philosophical messages. This course will consider both the philosophy of literature, such as what is literature and can subjective interpretations achieve truth, and philosophy through literature, in which we study philosophical concepts through literary works. Students will learn why we love to be scared, why tragedy is so appealing, what an individual's obligations are to herself and the state, etc."
